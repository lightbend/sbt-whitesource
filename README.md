[sbt]: http://www.scala-sbt.org/
[whitesource/agents]: https://github.com/whitesource/agents

## Setup

First, ensure you have permission to read from Lightbend's private Bintray repositories.

Then add this to `project/plugins.sbt` (or `project/whitesource.sbt` if you prefer one file per plugin):

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.lightbend" % "sbt-whitesource" % "0.1.6")
```

Next append to `credentials` in `~/.sbt/0.13/credentials.sbt`:

```scala
credentials += Credentials(realm = "whitesource", host = "whitesourcesoftware.com",
  userName = "", passwd = "********" /* Organization API Key */)
```

Finally in your `build.sbt` set the product name and the aggregate project name and token.
The project tokens are available from the [Integrate](https://saas.whitesourcesoftware.com/Wss/WSS.html#!adminOrganization_integration) page:

```scala
whitesourceProduct in ThisBuild               := "Lightbend Reactive Platform"
whitesourceAggregateProjectName in ThisBuild  := "akka-2.5"
whitesourceAggregateProjectToken in ThisBuild := "1234abc-******"
```

## Usage

Run `whitesourceUpdate` task to upload your projects' info to WhiteSource.

### Details
