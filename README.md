`sbt-whitesource` is an [sbt][] plugin to keep your WhiteSource project up to date. In WhiteSource terms it is
an [external update agent][whitesource/agents] for sbt.

[sbt]: http://www.scala-sbt.org/
[whitesource/agents]: https://github.com/whitesource/agents

## Setup

1. Add the sbt plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`, like so:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.lightbend" % "sbt-whitesource" % "0.1.18")
```

[ws-Integrate]: https://saas.whitesourcesoftware.com/Wss/WSS.html#!adminOrganization_integration

2. Set the Organization API Key (from WhiteSource's [Integrate][ws-Integrate] page) by appending to `credentials` in `~/.sbt/1.0/whitesource-credentials.sbt`, like so:

```scala
credentials += Credentials(realm = "whitesource", host = "whitesourcesoftware.com",
  userName = "", passwd = "********" /* Organization API Key */)
```

Or set the `WHITESOURCE_PASSWORD` environment variable to contain the organization API key.

On Travis CI, use its [Encrypted Environment Variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#defining-encrypted-variables-in-travisyml) feature.

For GitHub workflows, create a [Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) and reference it from the workflow:

```yaml
      - name: sbt "whitesourceCheckPolicies; whitesourceUpdate"
        run: sbt "whitesourceCheckPolicies; whitesourceUpdate"
        env:
          WHITESOURCE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.WHITESOURCE_PASSWORD }}
```

3. In your `build.sbt` set the product name and the aggregate project name and token, also available from WhiteSource's [Integrate][ws-Integrate] page:

```scala
whitesourceProduct in ThisBuild               := "Lightbend Reactive Platform"
whitesourceAggregateProjectName in ThisBuild  := "akka-2.5"
whitesourceAggregateProjectToken in ThisBuild := "1234abc-******"
```

## Usage

Run `whitesourceUpdate` task to upload your projects' info to WhiteSource.

## Configuration

This plugin is a port of [whitesource-maven-plugin][] v3.2.4 to sbt, providing very similar options and features.

[whitesource-maven-plugin]: https://github.com/whitesource/maven-plugin

### Interesting keys

The following keys might be of particular interest:

* `whitesourceServiceUrl in ThisBuild`: Specifies the WhiteSource Service URL (or IP) to use, for on-premise installations

## Debugging

As the whitesource library relies on the Apache `httpclient` its logging can be configured as described here:
https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/logging.html

For instance passing these options to sbt shows the requests and responses:

```
-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SimpleLog
-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showdatetime=true
-Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.org.apache.http=DEBUG
```

To view the diff payload, it needs to be urldecoded, base64-decoded and then un-gzipped.
